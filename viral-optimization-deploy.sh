git commit -m "Optimize clip generation with viral tags system

- Add comprehensive viral tags system with 50+ categories
- Implement realistic virality scoring based on content analysis
- Optimize LLM prompts for faster, more accurate clip detection
- Replace generic 'Why this clip hits' with specific viral tags
- Reduce temperature and token limits for faster generation
- Add tag-based scoring with realistic variation
- Update both main page and Whop experience page
- Improve hover overlays to show viral tags instead of generic text

Performance improvements:
- Faster clip generation with optimized prompts
- More accurate viral moment detection
- Realistic scoring system (not just multiples of 5)
- Better content categorization for viral potential"
